# Video Preview Fix

## Issue
Videos were not loading because they were in the `react-bits/public/assets/video/` folder which Vite couldn't serve directly.

## Solution
Copied all video files to `public/videos/` folder so Vite can serve them.

### Steps Taken

1. **Created public/videos directory**
```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "public/videos"
```

2. **Copied all videos**
```bash
Copy-Item -Path "react-bits\public\assets\video\*" -Destination "public\videos\" -Force
```

3. **Updated VideoPreview.tsx**
Changed video paths from:
```typescript
`../../../react-bits/public/assets/video/${videoName}.webm`
```

To:
```typescript
`/videos/${videoName}.webm`
```

## How It Works Now

1. Videos are in `public/videos/` folder
2. Vite serves `public/` folder at root URL
3. Videos are referenced as `/videos/filename.webm` and `/videos/filename.mp4`
4. Browser can load them directly

## File Structure

```
lovabolt/
├── public/
│   └── videos/          ← NEW! All videos copied here
│       ├── animatedcontent.mp4
│       ├── animatedcontent.webm
│       ├── blobcursor.mp4
│       ├── blobcursor.webm
│       └── ... (all 92 components × 2 formats = 184 files)
├── react-bits/
│   └── public/
│       └── assets/
│           └── video/   ← Original location (kept for reference)
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── cards/
            └── VideoPreview.tsx  ← Updated to use /videos/ path
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to Step 9 or Step 10 - videos should now load and play! ✅

## Notes

- Videos are ~184 files (92 components × 2 formats)
- Total size: ~50-100MB
- Vite serves them efficiently
- Browser caches them after first load

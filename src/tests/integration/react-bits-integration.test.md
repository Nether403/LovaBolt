**Steps**:
1. Navigate to application
2. Complete Project Setup step
3. Navigate through Layout, Design Style, Color Theme, Typography, Visuals
4. Select a background in Background step
5. Select multiple components in Components step
6. Navigate through Functionality
7. Select animations in Animations step
8. View final preview

**Expected Results**:
- All steps are accessible
- Selections persist across navigation
- Preview shows all selections
- No console errors

### Test 2: State Persistence Across Navigation

**Objective**: Verify selections are maintained when navigating backward and forward

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Background step
2. Select "Aurora" background
3. Navigate to Components step
4. Select "Carousel" and "Accordion"
5. Navigate back to Background step
6. Verify "Aurora" is still selected
7. Navigate forward to Components step
8. Verify "Carousel" and "Accordion" are still selected

**Expected Results**:
- All selections persist during backward navigation
- All selections persist during forward navigation
- Visual indicators show correct selection state

### Test 3: LocalStorage Save/Load

**Objective**: Verify project data is saved to and loaded from localStorage

**Steps**:
1. Complete wizard with selections
2. Verify localStorage contains project data
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify all selections are restored
5. Clear localStorage
6. Refresh the page
7. Verify app initializes with empty state

**Expected Results**:
- localStorage saves after selections
- Data persists across page refresh
- App handles missing localStorage gracefully

### Test 4: Prompt Generation with React-Bits

**Objective**: Verify generated prompt includes all react-bits selections

**Steps**:
1. Select "Aurora" background
2. Select "Carousel" and "Accordion" components
3. Select "Blob Cursor" animation
4. Navigate to Preview step
5. Verify prompt contains:
   - "## 7. Background Effect" section with Aurora
   - "## 8. UI Components" section with Carousel and Accordion
   - "## 9. UI/UX Animations" section with Blob Cursor
   - "## 12. React-Bits Installation" section with CLI commands

**Expected Results**:
- All sections present in prompt
- CLI commands are correct
- Dependencies are listed
- Installation instructions are clear

### Test 5: Edge Case - No Selections

**Objective**: Verify app handles no react-bits selections gracefully

**Steps**:
1. Navigate through wizard without selecting any react-bits components
2. Skip Background step (no selection)
3. Skip Components step (no selection)
4. Skip Animations step (no selection)
5. View Preview

**Expected Results**:
- App allows progression without selections
- Prompt shows "None" or "No selections" appropriately
- No errors or crashes

### Test 6: Edge Case - All Selections

**Objective**: Verify app handles maximum selections

**Steps**:
1. Select a background
2. Select all 37 components
3. Select all 25 animations
4. Navigate to Preview

**Expected Results**:
- All selections are tracked
- UI remains responsive
- Prompt includes all selections
- No performance issues

### Test 7: Edge Case - Mixed Selections

**Objective**: Verify various selection combinations work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Select background only
2. View preview (should show background, no components/animations)
3. Go back, add components only
4. View preview (should show background and components, no animations)
5. Go back, add animations
6. View preview (should show all three)

**Expected Results**:
- Each combination displays correctly
- Prompt updates appropriately
- State remains consistent

### Test 8: Backward Navigation State Integrity

**Objective**: Verify backward navigation maintains all state correctly

**Steps**:
1. Complete entire wizard with selections
2. From Preview, navigate back to Animations
3. Verify animations selections intact
4. Navigate back to Functionality
5. Verify functionality selections intact
6. Navigate back to Components
7. Verify components selections intact
8. Navigate back to Background
9. Verify background selection intact
10. Navigate forward through all steps
11. Verify all selections still present

**Expected Results**:
- All selections maintained during backward navigation
- All selections maintained during forward navigation after going back
- No data loss at any point

### Test 9: Modal Interactions

**Objective**: Verify modals work correctly in all steps

**Steps**:
1. In Background step, click "View Details" on a background
2. Verify modal opens with correct information
3. Copy CLI command
4. Close modal with Escape key
5. Repeat for Components step
6. Repeat for Animations step

**Expected Results**:
- Modals open correctly
- Information is accurate
- Copy functionality works
- Escape key closes modal
- Modal doesn't interfere with selections

### Test 10: Selection Toggle Behavior

**Objective**: Verify selection/deselection works correctly

**Steps**:
1. In Background step, select a background
2. Select a different background
3. Verify only one is selected
4. In Components step, select a component
5. Click same component again
6. Verify it's deselected
7. Select multiple components
8. Deselect one

   - Organized by purpose (utils, hooks, components, data)

3. **Implementation Guidelines** (Phase-by-phase)
   - **Phase 1**: Smart Defaults, Prompt Analyzer, Suggestions
   - **Phase 2**: NLP Parser, Compatibility Checker, Templates
   - **Phase 3**: Performance, Feedback, Documentation

4. **Critical Implementation Points** (For each task)
   - Data structures and algorithms
   - UI integration patterns
   - Testing checklists
   - Performance targets

5. **Common Patterns** (Reusable code patterns)
   - Safe AI execution with error handling
   - Debounced hooks for performance
   - Memoized components for optimization

6. **Integration Guidance**
   - How to update BoltBuilderContext
   - State management patterns
   - Event handling

7. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test examples
   - Integration test scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

8. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation patterns
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Error boundary implementation

9. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Keyboard navigation patterns
   - Screen reader support
   - Visual indicator guidelines

10. **Common Pitfalls** (What NOT to do)
    - Don't block user workflow
    - Don't override user choices
    - Don't hide AI reasoning

11. **Completion Checklist** (14 items)
    - All features implemented
    - Performance targets met
    - Tests passing
    - Documentation complete

## 📊 Comparison: Spec vs Steering

| Aspect | Spec Documents | New Steering Guide |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | What to build | How to build it |
| **Detail Level** | Requirements & architecture | Implementation patterns |
| **Code Examples** | Interface definitions | Working code snippets |
| **Testing** | Test scenarios | Specific test code |
| **Guidance** | What needs testing | How to test it |
| **Patterns** | Component structure | Reusable patterns |
| **Pitfalls** | Not covered | Common mistakes |
| **Integration** | High-level design | Specific integration steps |

## 🎯 Why This Addition Was Needed

### 1. Bridge the Gap
The spec tells you **what** to build, but the steering guide tells you **how** to build it with LovaBolt's specific patterns and conventions.

### 2. Practical Examples
While the spec has interface definitions, the steering guide has working code snippets you can copy and adapt.

### 3. Common Pitfalls
The steering guide explicitly calls out mistakes to avoid, which aren't covered in the spec.

### 4. Integration Patterns
Shows exactly how to integrate AI features with existing BoltBuilderContext and wizard flow.

### 5. Testing Guidance
Provides specific test code examples, not just test scenarios.

### 6. Performance Optimization
Concrete patterns for memoization, debouncing, and optimization.

## 📋 Recommendations

### ✅ Ready to Start Implementation

The spec and steering documents are now complete and comprehensive. You can proceed with implementation following this workflow:

1. **Read the Spec** (`.kiro/specs/ai-intelligence-features/`)
   - Understand requirements and architecture
   - Review design decisions
   - Familiarize with task list

2. **Read the Steering Guide** (`.kiro/steering/ai-intelligence-implementation.md`)
   - Learn implementation patterns
   - Review code examples
   - Understand common pitfalls

3. **Start with Phase 1, Task 1** (Smart Defaults)
   - Follow the critical implementation points
   - Use the provided code patterns
   - Check off the testing checklist

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Run unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Measure performance

5. **Iterate**
   - Gather feedback
   - Refine algorithms
   - Optimize performance

### 🔄 No Changes Needed to Existing Docs

The existing spec documents are excellent and don't need modification. The new steering guide complements them perfectly.

### 📚 Document Hierarchy

```
AI Intelligence Features Documentation
│
├── Spec (What to build)
│   ├── requirements.md - User stories & acceptance criteria
│   ├── design.md - Technical architecture
│   └── tasks.md - Implementation checklist
│
└── Steering (How to build it)
    ├── lovabolt-standards.md - General standards
    └── ai-intelligence-implementation.md - AI-specific guidance ← NEW
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Spec Review Complete** - All documents reviewed and assessed
2. ✅ **Steering Guide Created** - Implementation guidance added
3. ⏭️ **Ready for Implementation** - Can start coding Phase 1, Task 1

### Suggested Implementation Order

1. **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 (Smart Defaults, Prompt Analyzer, Suggestions)
2. **Week 3-4**: Phase 2 (NLP Parser, Compatibility Checker, Templates)
3. **Week 5**: Phase 3 (Performance, Feedback, Documentation)

### Key Success Factors

- Follow the steering guide's patterns
- Test each feature before moving on
- Measure performance continuously
- Gather user feedback early
- Iterate based on data

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. Check the steering guide for patterns
2. Review the spec for requirements
3. Look at existing code for examples
4. Ask for clarification when needed

## ✨ Summary

**Status**: ✅ **Ready to Implement**

- Spec is complete and comprehensive
- New steering guide provides practical implementation guidance
- All patterns and examples are ready to use
- Testing strategy is clear
- Performance targets are defined
- No blockers to starting implementation

You can confidently begin implementing the AI intelligence features following the Phase 1 tasks in the spec, using the patterns and guidance from the new steering document.

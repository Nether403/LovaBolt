# Core Platform Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines improvements to LovaBolt's core platform focusing on critical fixes, performance optimization, code quality, user experience enhancements, and accessibility compliance. These improvements maintain the "no bloat" principle while significantly enhancing the application's stability, performance, and usability.

## Glossary

- **Build System**: Vite-based build and bundling configuration
- **Wizard Steps**: Individual pages in the multi-step wizard interface
- **React-Bits Components**: The 93 pre-built components integrated into the system
- **Bundle**: The compiled JavaScript/CSS output for production deployment
- **Code Splitting**: Technique to load code on-demand rather than upfront
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines level AA compliance
- **LocalStorage**: Browser storage mechanism for persisting user data

### Requirement 4: Input Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback on invalid inputs, so that I can correct mistakes before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project name is entered, THE LovaBolt System SHALL validate it is between 3 and 50 characters
2. WHEN project description is entered, THE LovaBolt System SHALL validate it is between 10 and 500 characters
3. IF validation fails, THEN THE LovaBolt System SHALL display specific error messages below the affected field
4. WHEN required fields are empty, THE LovaBolt System SHALL prevent navigation to the next step
5. WHEN validation passes, THE LovaBolt System SHALL allow the user to proceed without errors

### Requirement 5: Search and Filter Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter through 93 React-Bits components, so that I can quickly find what I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search query is entered, THE LovaBolt System SHALL filter components matching the title or description
2. WHEN a tag filter is selected, THE LovaBolt System SHALL display only components with that tag
3. WHEN multiple filters are active, THE LovaBolt System SHALL apply all filters using AND logic
4. WHEN search results update, THE LovaBolt System SHALL display the count of matching components
5. WHEN filters are cleared, THE LovaBolt System SHALL restore the full component list

### Requirement 6: Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a power user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common actions, so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ctrl/Cmd + Right Arrow is pressed, THE LovaBolt System SHALL navigate to the next wizard step
2. WHEN Ctrl/Cmd + Left Arrow is pressed, THE LovaBolt System SHALL navigate to the previous wizard step
3. WHEN Ctrl/Cmd + G is pressed, THE LovaBolt System SHALL generate and display the prompt
4. WHEN Escape is pressed in a modal, THE LovaBolt System SHALL close the modal
5. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are used, THE LovaBolt System SHALL prevent default browser behavior

### Requirement 7: Undo/Redo Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to undo and redo my selections, so that I can experiment without fear of losing my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a selection is made, THE LovaBolt System SHALL add the previous state to the undo history
2. WHEN the undo action is triggered, THE LovaBolt System SHALL restore the previous state
3. WHEN the redo action is triggered, THE LovaBolt System SHALL restore the next state in history
4. WHEN no undo history exists, THE LovaBolt System SHALL disable the undo button
5. WHEN no redo history exists, THE LovaBolt System SHALL disable the redo button

### Requirement 8: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible, so that I can use it with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE LovaBolt System SHALL provide skip navigation links for keyboard users
2. WHEN interactive elements are focused, THE LovaBolt System SHALL display visible focus indicators
3. WHEN buttons contain only icons, THE LovaBolt System SHALL provide aria-label attributes
4. WHEN modals open, THE LovaBolt System SHALL trap focus within the modal
5. WHEN modals close, THE LovaBolt System SHALL return focus to the triggering element

### Requirement 9: TypeScript Strictness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strict TypeScript checking, so that type errors are caught at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build System SHALL enable strict mode in TypeScript configuration
